## Overview

Mining is one of the most hazardous industries, with workers exposed to harsh and dangerous conditions. This Miner Health Monitoring System is developed to monitor miners' vital signs (such as heart rate, temperature, and oxygen levels) and environmental factors (like gas concentration, humidity, and temperature) using IoT sensors. The collected data is processed and analyzed to provide real-time alerts and historical reports, improving miners' safety and response times in emergencies.

## Features

- **Real-time Health Monitoring:** Tracks vital signs of miners using wearable IoT devices.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Monitors underground conditions (e.g., gas, temperature, humidity).
- **Alert System:** Sends instant alerts to supervisors if abnormal conditions are detected.
- **Data Visualization:** Dashboard for visualizing collected data and trends.
- **Remote Access:** Authorized personnel can access data from anywhere.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Easily add more sensors or integrate with other systems.

## Architecture

The system typically consists of the following components:

- **Wearable Sensor Nodes:** Collect miners' health data.
- **Environmental Sensors:** Monitor factors like gas, temperature, and humidity.
- **Gateway Device:** Aggregates data from sensors and transmits it to the server.
- **Backend Server:** Stores, processes, and analyzes the data.
- **Dashboard/Web Interface:** Allows users to monitor status, view reports, and configure alerts.
